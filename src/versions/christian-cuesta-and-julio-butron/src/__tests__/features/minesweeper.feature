Feature: Minesweeper
      As a player:
      - I want to play to the classic minesweeper game
      - So I want to detect all the mines in the board
      How to refer to a cell:
      - Using the (row,column) nomenclature
      - Rows and columns starts from 1
      How to load mock data:
      - Using the <ctrl>+m keyboard combination to discover
      the load mock data form
      To define the board data will use:
      "o" No mine
      "*" Mine
      "-" Row separator
      Thera are two ways to define mock data:
      - Inline:
      "*-ooo-*oo"
      - Table:
      | * | * | * |
      | o | o | o |
      | * | o | o |
  To define the board display will use:
  COVERED CELLS
  "." Hidden cell
  "!" Cell tagged has mined cell by the user
  "?" Cell tagged has inconclusive cell by the user
  "x" Cell wrongly tagged has no mined cell by the user
  UNCOVERED CELLS
  "0" Empty cell
  "1" Clean cell with 1 adjacent mine
  "2" Clean cell with 2 adjacent mines
  "3" Clean cell with 3 adjacent mines
  "4" Clean cell with 4 adjacent mines
  "5" Clean cell with 5 adjacent mines
  "6" Clean cell with 6 adjacent mines
  "7" Clean cell with 7 adjacent mines
  "8" Clean cell with 8 adjacent mines
  "9" Clean cell with 9 adjacent mines
  "@" highlighted mine

  Background:
    Given the player opens the game


  Scenario: Starting game - All the cells should be hidden
    Then all the cells should be covered

  Scenario: Starting game - All the cells should be enabled
    Then all the cells should be enabled

  Scenario: Flag Marker Counter
    Then the counter should start with 15

  Scenario: Uncovering a cell - Disabling the cell
    Given the player loads the following mock data:
      """
      | * | o | * |
      | o | * | o |
      """
    When the player uncovers the cell (1,2)
    Then the cell (1,2) should be disabled

  Scenario: Timer Start
    Given the player loads the following mock data:
      """
      | * | o | * |
      | o | * | o |
      """
    When the player uncovers the cell (1,2)

    Then the timer should show 1

  Scenario: Timer don't Start
    Given the player loads the following mock data:
      """
      | * | o | * |
